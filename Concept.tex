\chapter{Concept}
In this chapter the developed concept will be presented. 
\section{System}
The hardware used with this system consists of:
\begin{itemize}
  \item a tracked ultrasound device
  \item a tracked pointer tool
  \item an optical tracking camera to track the instruments
  \item a computer to run the software
  \item a 3D-monitor which displays the 3D contents of the software 
  \item a touch-screen on a 2D-monitor to operate the software and show the
    ultrasound images
\end{itemize}
The software in this system consists of:
\begin{itemize}
  \item a sampling method to collect points on the liver-surface
  \item a reconstruction method to reconstruct the surface from the sampled points
  \item a segmentation method to segment the tumors on the ultrasound images
  \item a planning method to plan the resection of the liver
  \item a navigation mode used to navigate during the removal of the tumor
\end{itemize}
\section{Functionalities}
The three main functionalities of the developed concept will be presented in
this chapter. These functionalities were specifically developed for this project.
\subsection{Surface Reconstruction}
During surgery ultrasound images and their corresponding 6D poses (positions and
orientations) are collected and analyzed. First each ultrasound image has to be
checked for contact with the liver. If the ultrasound passes the check, that
means the ultrasound image looks like an ultrasound image that can only arise
when the ultrasound probe lies on the liver surface, then the position of this
image can be used.

In order to use the sampled position corresponding to an image, this
position has to be transformed into the correct coordinate system first. There
are four different coordinate systems. The first coordinate system is the image
coordinate system. The units in the image coordinate system are pixels and the
origin is in the top left corner of the image. The
second coordinate system is the ultrasound coordinate system. The origin of this
coordinate system is at the probe tip in the middle and the units in this and
the following coordinate systems are millimeters. The third coordinate system is the
ultrasound-tool-marker coordinate system. The origin is ... . The final
coordinate system is the tracking camera coordinate system. The origin of this
coordinate system is at the position sensor in the tracking camera and can not
be changed.

At the end of this transformation chain, a image pixel 2D position was
transformed into a tracking camera 3D positon and the units changed
from pixel to millimeter. This location in the tracking camera coordinate system
will be added to the collection of points to later reconstruct the surface from.
