\chapter{Concept}
In this chapter the developed concept will be presented. 
\section{System}
The hardware used with this system consists of:
\begin{itemize}
  \item a tracked ultrasound device
  \item a tracked pointer tool
  \item an optical tracking camera to track the instruments
  \item a computer to run the software
  \item a 3D-monitor which displays the 3D contents of the software 
  \item a touch-screen on a 2D-monitor to operate the software and show the
    ultrasound images
\end{itemize}
The software in this system consists of:
\begin{itemize}
  \item a sampling method to collect points on the liver-surface
  \item a reconstruction method to reconstruct the surface from the sampled points
  \item a segmentation method to segment the tumors on the ultrasound images
  \item a planning method to plan the resection of the liver
  \item a navigation mode used to navigate during the removal of the tumor
\end{itemize}
