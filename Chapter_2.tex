\subsection{Porosity Estimation}

To parametrize the computational model the porosity of each foam type needs to be estimated from representative $\mu\text{CT}$ data. Remember the definition of porosity as the ratio of the void volume and the total volume. $\mu\text{CT}$ data is present in the form of binary data, i.e.

\begin{equation}
   v_{m,n,p}\in\left\{0,1\right\}\qquad\forall m,n,p\,.
\end{equation}

\noindent $v_{m,n,p}$ refers to the voxel value at instant position $\left(m,n,p\right)$ in the three-dimensional $\mu\text{CT}$ data array ${\mathbf V}$. Hence the porosity can be estimated as the ratio of voxels with an associated value of 0 and the overall number of voxels. Let

\begin{align*}
   V&=\left\{v_{m,n,p}\right\} & \forall & v_{m,n,p}\in {\mathbf V} \\
   V_0&=\left\{v_{m,n,p}\right\} & \forall & v_{m,n,p}\in {\mathbf V}\wedge v_{m,n,p}=0 \\
   V_1&=\left\{v_{m,n,p}\right\} & \forall & v_{m,n,p}\in {\mathbf V}\wedge v_{m,n,p}=1 \\
   & & & V_0 \subseteq V\,,\quad V_1 \subseteq V\,.
\end{align*}

\noindent $V$ is the set of all voxels, $V_0$ the set of voxels with an associated value of $0$ and $V_1$ the set of voxels with an associated value of $1$ in the binary data array ${\mathbf V}$. Therefore $V=V_0\cup V_1$. The porosity measure is then given by

\begin{equation}
   \overline{\beta} = \frac{\left|V_0\right|}{\left|V\right|}=1-\frac{\left|V_1\right|}{\left|V\right|}\,.
\end{equation}

\noindent $\left|S\right|$ is the \textit{cardinality}, i.e. the size or number of members of the set $S$. Notice that $\left|V\right|=M\cdot N\cdot P$, meaning the size of the set $V$ is equal to the number of voxels stored in the array ${\mathbf V}$.

The different porosity levels for the foams with $\left\{20,\, 30,\,40\right\}\,\text{PPI}$ pore density are presented in Tab.~\ref{tab:FoamPorosities}.
