  abstract = {A method is introduced to decrease the computational labor of the
	standard level set method for propagating interfaces. The fast approach
	uses only points close to the curve at every time step. We describe
	this new algorithm and compare its efficiency and accuracy with the
	standard level set approach.},

  abstract = {The mechanical behaviour of trabecular bone is dependent on both the
	properties of individual trabeculae as well as their three-dimensional
	arrangement in space. In this study, nanoindentation was used to
	determine trabecular stiffness of bovine bone, both dehydrated and
	rehydrated. Values of 18.3 GPa and 14.3 GPa were obtained for dehydrated
	and rehydrated trabeculae respectively. These values were then used
	for finite element analysis where the mesh was generated directly
	from an X-ray microtomography dataset. The relationship between intrinsic
	tissue properties and apparent stiffness was explored. Moreover,
	the important role of collagen in bone micromechanics was demonstrated
	by complementing the study with Raman spectroscopy.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present and analyze different volume-of-fluid (VOF)
	reconstruction and advection algorithms that approximate the interface
	separating two immiscible fluids in the three-dimensional space.
	The paper describes the improvement of the reconstruction when a
	least-square fit algorithm, which minimizes a distance functional,
	is applied. Its performance is tested for several smooth surfaces
	against other simple reconstruction methods. Then Eulerian, Lagrangian
	and mixed split advection schemes are presented and analyzed. In
	particular, one advection method is discussed that conserves mass
	exactly for a divergence-free velocity field, thus allowing computations
	to machine precision.},
