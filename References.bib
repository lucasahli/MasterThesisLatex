	determine trabecular stiffness of bovine bone, both dehydrated and
	rehydrated. Values of 18.3 GPa and 14.3 GPa were obtained for dehydrated
	and rehydrated trabeculae respectively. These values were then used
	for finite element analysis where the mesh was generated directly
	from an X-ray microtomography dataset. The relationship between intrinsic
	tissue properties and apparent stiffness was explored. Moreover,
	the important role of collagen in bone micromechanics was demonstrated
	by complementing the study with Raman spectroscopy.},

	The paper describes the improvement of the reconstruction when a

	is applied. Its performance is tested for several smooth surfaces
	against other simple reconstruction methods. Then Eulerian, Lagrangian
