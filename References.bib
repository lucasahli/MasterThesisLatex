pages="249--264",
abstract="Resection is the established gold-standard treatment of colorectal liver metastases. The surgical management of colorectal liver metastases has changed dramatically during the past three decades with the diffusion of the parenchymal-sparing liver resection. This approach involves preserving healthy functional liver parenchyma by performing a wide range of liver resections, ranging from small non-anatomical wedge resections to complex atypical non-anatomical resections, to segmentectomies or subsegmentectomies. Site and relationships of the tumor with glissonian pedicles or hepatic veins have to be exactly identified, in order to perform the appropriate type of resection. Therefore, it is clear that only the intensive use of intraoperative liver ultrasound makes it possible to perform parenchymal-sparing liver resections. The same strategy can be applied with the laparoscopic approach. The parenchymal-sparing liver resection is supported by pathological, oncological, and technical reasons. This approach reduces postoperative mortality and morbidity rates, better preserves postoperative liver function, thus decreasing the risk of liver dysfunction, offers similar survival results, and increases the opportunity of re-resection in case of recurrence.",

  abstract = {In this paper we present and analyze different volume-of-fluid (VOF)
	reconstruction and advection algorithms that approximate the interface
	separating two immiscible fluids in the three-dimensional space.
	The paper describes the improvement of the reconstruction when a
	least-square fit algorithm, which minimizes a distance functional,
	is applied. Its performance is tested for several smooth surfaces
	against other simple reconstruction methods. Then Eulerian, Lagrangian
	and mixed split advection schemes are presented and analyzed. In
	particular, one advection method is discussed that conserves mass
	exactly for a divergence-free velocity field, thus allowing computations
	to machine precision.},
