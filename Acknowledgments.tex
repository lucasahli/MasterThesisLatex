\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
First, I would like to thank my thesis supervisors, Iwan Paolucci and
  Prof. Dr.-Ing. Stefan Weber of the IGT group in the ARTORG Center for
  Biomedical Engineering, who supported and steered my work in the right
  direction with a lot of helpful advices.
  I would also like to thank the other
  members of the IGT group for their support during the thesis and the discussions
  during the coffee breaks. 
  A special thanks goes to the surgeons who
  participated in the phantom experiments, namely Dr. med. Pascale Tinguely, Dr.
  Gabriela Pereira Bom Braga and Dr. Catherine Tsai, MD for their valuable
  inputs and feedbacks. Another special thanks goes to Raluca Sandu and Ankit
  Gupta for their everyday support and proofreading of the thesis.
 Last but not least I would also like to thank my parents, brothers and friends for their support regardless
of the field.
