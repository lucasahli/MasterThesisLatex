\chapter{Problem Statement}
To make computer assisted navigation in liver resection surgeries more
accessible to liver surgeons, a new concept has to be developed in order to do
some first testings.
Specifically, the method should fulfill the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The software should guide the surgeon through the surgical procedure.
  \item A 3D-model of the liver should be created during the surgery.
  \item The planning for the resection of the tumor should be done
    intraoperatively on the created 3D-model.
  \item The method should be ready for testings in the OR.
\end{itemize}
